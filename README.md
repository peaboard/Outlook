## An Exploration Into Active Ambient Environments

## Forked from the project [Outset](https://github.com/deucks/Outset) Copyright 2014 Raajit Sharma

### Concept 

Do images in pheripheral vision affect experiences with tasks. 

This web app grabs random images from http://unsplash.com and displays it on the screen, continously changing it at intervals. 

Do try it out - run it on a visible fullscreen while reading a book or doing chores.

It has also been used as a placeholder on screens for meetings, gatherings and conferences. 

### How to Use

* Set time in the panel on the left.
* Hover over the panel to make it visible.
* Double click on screen or press Fulscreen button to go into fulscreen mode. Press Esc to exit fulscreen mode.
* Click on the optional checkbox to blur all images. 

### Imporovements over original project:

* Hovering for settings 
* Hide cursor when inactive 
* Fullscreen Mode
